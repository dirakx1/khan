# Khan
* Distributed AI for IOT applications
* your finetunned data plataforms form ondevice AI models. 

## Caracteristics
* Each IOT node has its own LLM, with minimal computation (Low resource LLModels).
* Each IOT node has sensors and actuators.
* Each node has communication to any other node on the IOT network, sends sensors data and the posible actuation data to actuators
* The data sent to each other node finetune the LLMs inside each IOT node and then replies if there is consensus (consensus, distributed algorithm) then the X,Y,Z actuator can perform.
