Distributed AI for iot implementations

## Caracteristics
* Each IOT node has its own LLM, with minimal computation.
* Each IOT node has sensors and actuators
* Each node has communication to any other node on the IOT network, sends sensors data and the posible actuation data to actuators
* The data sent to each other node finestunning the LLMs inside each IOT node and then replys if theres is consensus (consesus) algorithn .. the X actuator can perform.
